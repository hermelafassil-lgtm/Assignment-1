For the three ports I have tablet.css, laptop.css and mobile.css. The template I used for these three css files are from the tablet.css (5) file provided by proffeser Sheikh. 

The main changes that I made to file 5 was change the right coloumb size for the tablet height to 800px. For the Laptop right coloumb size I made it 900. For the mobile right columb size I made id 600px. 
Another change that I made was For the n the left columb I added the tablet height ot be set at 120px and the laptop sizeto be set to 120px. And the Mobile size is not included. For the footer I made the tablet size of 80px and the laptop size of 80px and the mobile size is 80px. 
For the Button sizes I made them large for the tablet, x-large for the lapop and medium for the mobile. I chose these options for the sizes becasue I wanted them to incrses the same why they do screen sizes.
